Contains aliases and scripts I often use. Just clone this repo **in your home folder** and run `echo "source ~/zsh-aliases/aliases.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc`. After restarting zsh you should be able to use all aliases and scripts. Only tested on Kali Linux, you might need to install additional dependencies on other distros.
